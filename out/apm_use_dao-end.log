           +/- 3  By increasing/decreasing  Y  coordinate

           +/- 4  By increasing/decreasing magnitude

           +/- n  By increasing/decreasing OTHER (n <= 30)



                                 Which do you want?                                    Input file name:           Output file name (default MNDra2001.srt):                   Do you want the stars renumbered?
